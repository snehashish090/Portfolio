    <h2>Understanding</h2>

    <h3>Which aspect of the programme excites you the most? Which aspect seems most challenging?</h3>
    <p>The most exciting part of CAS is the opportunity to engage in hands-on learning beyond academics. I look forward to combining my interests in technology, music, and service to create meaningful projects. The most challenging aspect is maintaining a balance between the three strands while managing my academic workload.</p>

    <h3>What do you most hope to achieve from CAS?</h3>
    <p>I hope to develop leadership and teamwork skills while making a tangible impact in my community. Additionally, I aim to improve my ability to reflect on my experiences and learn from them.</p>

    <h3>How do you think your CAS programme will enable you to grow?</h3>
    <p>CAS will help me grow by pushing me out of my comfort zone. Through different activities, I will develop resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. These qualities align with the IB Learner Profile attributes such as being a risk-taker, communicator, and reflective thinker.</p>

    <h3>How will you plan for an equal distribution of CAS strands across your CAS experiences?</h3>
    <p>I will create a structured CAS plan where I dedicate time weekly to each strand. I will track my progress through a journal and ensure I am engaging in a balanced number of activities in Creativity, Activity, and Service.</p>

    <h2>Student Interests</h2>

    <h3>What are your main interests? How can you incorporate these interests into your CAS programme?</h3>
    <p>My main interests are music production, coding, physics, and badminton. I plan to integrate them into CAS by composing original soundtracks, developing an app for an NGO, participating in physics-related service initiatives, and playing badminton as my physical activity.</p>

    <h3>What issues of local significance concern you most?</h3>
    <p>Issues such as the water crisis and environmental sustainability are significant concerns. I aim to address these through projects like the Carbon Net Neutral Project and implementing water conservation measures in my school.</p>

    <h2>Evidence of CAS</h2>

    <h3>Have you thought of how you will keep evidence?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I plan to maintain a digital CAS portfolio using Notion. I will log my reflections, add photos, and upload project reports to track my progress.</p>

    <h3>How can you keep track of your plans and meeting the learning outcomes through your portfolio?</h3>
    <p>I will use a digital CAS journal to document each experience, categorize them by learning outcomes, and set reminders for reflection entries to ensure consistent progress tracking.</p>
