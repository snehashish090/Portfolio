  <h1>About The Internship</h1>
  <div class="custom-container">
    <div class="about-text"><p>
        From 15th April 2023 to 15th July 2024, I worked as a part time intern / volunteer at Harsha Trust, a NGO that works in rural Odisha for rural empowerment and community well-being. 
        Every time I would return from my boarding school, I would work here and I spent a total of 180 days throughout my internship period. The problem I was trying told to tackle was 
        optimising the flow of data from the fields to the main office. The NGO has a vaccination and deworming programme for livestock that aims to provide well-timed vaccines to livetsock owned 
        by rural housholds dependent on those housholds. This project is aimed on reducing mortality rates and protect the livelihoods of tribal households in Odisha. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To build this information system, I collected variables and requirements from the stakeholder and used them to create data tables. 
        Next, I spent time in the office developing the mobile app according to the deliverables.
        I used React-Native to build the iOS and android apps. I went over multiple iterations with the stakeholders including addition of location tracking and offline syncing.
        After building the prototype, I spent about a week in the fields where I worked on collecting feedback and testing the app. Once the app was fine tuned, I worked on building the data infrastructure. 
        I used AWS to setup multiple micro services to manage the API that acted as a bridge between the monitoring dashboard and the mobile app. I then wrote algorithms to classify data, calculate mortality rates and coverage
        which were then displayed in the forms of graphs and reports. I then created documentation and manuals and provided training to the the management team. 
    </p>    

    <p>
        The exact tasks of my internship are listed below:
        <ul>
            <li>Design a cross-platform mobile application ot capture data on vaccination and deworming of livestock from 74 blocks in 17 districts in the state of Odisha.</li>
            <li>Implement an information system with a database to store and record al existing ground operations and adjust for future changes with an estimated record of over 100000 to 150000 beneficiaries.</li>
            <li>Develop a web interface with a dashboard to display graphs and statistics which wil be used to optimize the vaccination and deworming programs.</li>
            <li>Spend a week in field visits to Hatadihi and Bissamcuttack to assess and model the data collection process.</li>
            <li>Provide training to the MIS team on how ot use the system effectively and write a detailed 24 page manual and documentation and share ti with al team leaders for further training.</li>
        </ul>
